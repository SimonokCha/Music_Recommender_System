# Music_Recommender_System
We designed a music recommendation system using a dataset of over 28,000 Spotify tracks containing both audio features and full lyrics. Our goal was to build two systems: one based on traditional content-based Gltering, and another enhanced by Natural Language Processing (NLP) to capture lyrical sentiment.
